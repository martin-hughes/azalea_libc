# Libc porting status

This file contains details of the status of the project to port musl to form Azalea libc. A simple file is used so as
to avoid a large number of tracking issues - this way, the bug tracker can be used for actual bugs.

## Overview

At present, this project is in very early stages. Most features do not work at all in Azalea - details of those that do
can be found in the section [Features grouped by header](#features-grouped-by-header).

It is also notable that no significant testing has been carried out.

## Major deficiencies

These deficiencies represent features that are incompletely ported compared to how the library should work if it had
been fully ported to Azalea.

- There is no support for the "aux" variable.
- Exit codes are not supported.
- Thread IDs are always set to zero.
- There are a whole load of warnings generated.
- File mode flags are basically unsupported.
- mmap only maps, it doesn't look at any of the flags or other nice features.

## Minor deficiencies

- Futexes do not support the private flag, nor waking more than one thread at a time. (see __futexwait and __wake)
- mremap doesn't support moved or shrinking remaps, only expanding ones.

Various other minor deficiencies can be found by searching "Azalea deficiency" in the source tree.

## Features grouped by header

### C99 Headers

Status | File name | Notes
---------|-----------|------
not started | assert.h | Requires files support
not started | complex.h | Needs floating point support to work first
incomplete | ctype.h | Compiles but not tested.
incomplete | errno.h | Not tested, but should just work
not started | fenv.h | Needs floating point support to work first
not started | float.h | Needs floating point support to work first
not started | inttypes.h | Not expecting changes from musl version
Completed | iso646.h | No changes from musl version
Completed | limits.h | No changes from musl version
not started | locale.h | Lots of things, but at first glance doesn't look too system dependent.
not started | math.h | Requires floating point math, and a careful check not to duplicate anything.
not started | setjmp.h | Ought not be too bad.
not started | signal.h | Probably a fair amount of work - we don't do "signals" as such.
Completed | stdalign.h | No changes from musl version
incomplete | stdarg.h | Not tested, but should just work
not started | stdatomic.h | Not part of the musl library?
Completed | stdbool.h | No changes from musl version
incomplete | stddef.h | Not tested, but should just work
incomplete | stdint.h | No changes made, not expecting any.
incomplete | stdio.h | A fair amount of work. Requires a method for pushing stdout/in/err to the user program. Malloc/free do now work.
incomplete | stdlib.h | Ported but not fully tested. Malloc-type functions still to come.
Completed | stdnoreturn.h | No changes from musl version. Only a single macro.
incomplete | string.h | Ported but not fully tested
not started | tgmath.h | Probably not too much work
not started | threads.h | Plenty of work, although largely I think it's a case of swapping syscalls - and extending the Azalea calls that are available.
not started | time.h | Requires quite a lot of work on the kernel
not started | uchar.h | Looks like not too much work.
not started | wchar.h | Could be quite a lot of work.
not started | wctype.h | Oughtn't be too bad.
