# Libc porting status

This file contains details of the status of the project to port musl to form Azalea libc. A simple file is used so as
to avoid a large number of tracking issues - this way, the bug tracker can be used for actual bugs.

## Overview

At present, this project is in very early stages. Most features do not work at all in Azalea - details of those that do
can be found in the section [Features grouped by header](#features-grouped-by-header).

It is also notable that no significant testing has been carried out.

## Major deficiencies

These deficiencies represent features that are incompletely ported compared to how the library should work if it had
been fully ported to Azalea.

- There is no support for the "aux" variable.
- Exit codes are not supported.
- Thread IDs are always set to zero.
- There are a whole load of warnings generated.
- File mode flags are basically unsupported.
- mmap only maps, it doesn't look at any of the flags or other nice features. It also can't memory map files!
- errno is per-process, not per-thread!
- There is no support for pthread, which means some locks are not valid - there are places in the code marked with
  /* PTHREAD where locking code has been commented out.

## Minor deficiencies

- Futexes do not support the private flag, nor waking more than one thread at a time. (see __futexwait and __wake)
- mremap doesn't support moved or shrinking remaps, only expanding ones.

Various other minor deficiencies can be found by searching "Azalea deficiency" in the source tree.

## Features grouped by header

### C99 Headers

Note: At this point, basically none of these features have been thoroughly tested. Having a status of Completed doesn't
necessarily mean working properly!

Status | Tested? | File name | Notes
-------|---------|-----------|-------
Completed | No | assert.h | Should now work.
Completed | No | complex.h | Compiled in but untested.
Completed | No | ctype.h | Compiles but not tested.
Broken | No | errno.h | Only one errno per process is given. Better thread support is needed in order to re-enable per-thread errno.
Completed | Partial | fenv.h | All functions added, but only very basic testing completed.
Completed | N/A | float.h | Header doesn't declare new functionality, only constants.
Completed | No | inttypes.h | No changes from musl version
Completed | No | iso646.h | No changes from musl version
Completed | No | limits.h | No changes from musl version
Completed | No | locale.h | Included in the library, but not tested.
Completed | Partial | math.h | All functions are included. Only basic floating point testing completed.
not started | No | setjmp.h | Ought not be too bad.
not started | No | signal.h | Probably a fair amount of work - we don't do "signals" as such.
Completed | No | stdalign.h | No changes from musl version
Completed | No | stdarg.h | Not tested, but should just work
not started | No | stdatomic.h | Not part of the musl library?
Completed | No | stdbool.h | No changes from musl version
Completed | No | stddef.h | Not tested, but should just work
Completed | No | stdint.h | No changes made, not expecting any.
incomplete | No | stdio.h | A fair amount of work left, although a large proportion of file-based functionality works.
Completed | No | stdlib.h | I think all parts of this are included in the library now, but I may be wrong.
Completed | No | stdnoreturn.h | No changes from musl version. Only a single macro.
Completed | No | string.h | Ported but not fully tested
Completed | No | tgmath.h | Untested. I think this is simply a set of macro definitions around math.h and complex.h
not started | No | threads.h | Plenty of work, although largely I think it's a case of swapping syscalls - and extending the Azalea calls that are available.
incomplete | No | time.h | Most functions work, but sleeping does not, not does setting timers. Other minor omissions too.
not started | No | uchar.h | Looks like not too much work.
not started | No | wchar.h | Could be quite a lot of work.
not started | No | wctype.h | Oughtn't be too bad.

### Other Headers

Status | Tested? | File name | Notes
-------|---------|-----------|-------
incomplete | No | unistd.h | It's highly recommended to avoid using this header. Most of the supported functions have been quickly hacked together and probably don't work correctly. Frankly a bit of a mess.
incomplete | No | getopt.h | Should just work.
incomplete | No | termios.h | Some pretty minimal work has been completed - tc(set|set)attr are implemented but only support a trivial set of flags.
