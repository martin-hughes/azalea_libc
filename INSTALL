To build Azalea libc:

1. Ensure that you have configured the azalea_header_folder variable in
   SConstruct to point at the location of the Azalea user interface headers.
2. Adjust the variable install_folder in SConstruct to a suitable value
3. In the root of the tree, execute `scons`
4. To install the updated library, execute `scons install`

Prerequisites:

- The Azalea header files. The Azalea source code can be found at
  https://github.com/martin-hughes/project_azalea.
- Scons.
