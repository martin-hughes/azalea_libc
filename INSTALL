To build Azalea libc:

1. In the root of the tree, execute `scons`. If you have not built the library before you will be given errors that
   will tell you the command line parameters that need to be set. These only need to be set for the first build, they
   are remembered for future builds.
2. To install the updated library, execute `scons install`

Prerequisites:

- The Azalea header files. The Azalea source code can be found at
  https://github.com/martin-hughes/project_azalea.
- Scons.
